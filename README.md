## Technologies

Our application is built upon a carefully selected technology stack designed to enhance the performance, scalability, and maintainability of the software. Below is an outline of the key technologies used and the rationale behind their selection.

### [React ](https://react.dev/) üöÄ

React serves as the core framework for building our web application. Its component-based architecture enables the creation of reusable, interactive UI elements with efficient state management. Powered by a virtual DOM, React ensures high performance and seamless user experiences. Backed by a strong community and maintained by Meta, it offers a robust ecosystem for developing scalable and maintainable web applications.


### [TailWind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) üî•

Tailwind CSS is used as the utility-first CSS framework for styling our web application. It allows us to rapidly build modern, responsive UIs directly within our HTML or JSX by using pre-defined utility classes. This approach eliminates the need for writing custom CSS, enhances consistency across the design, and speeds up the development process. Its flexibility and responsiveness make it ideal for creating clean, scalable, and maintainable user interfaces.

### [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) üçÉ

We selected MongoDB as our primary database due to its flexibility and scalability. MongoDB's document-oriented structure is well-suited for storing complex and hierarchical data, which aligns perfectly with the diverse and dynamic data we deal with in the Dental Lab Management app. This enables us to iterate quickly, manage data efficiently, and scale as needed.
